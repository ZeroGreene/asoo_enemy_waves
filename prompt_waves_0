How it should work:
0. We build the waves on screen 

1. Drag each wave over into the inspector 

2. When all ships of the current wave kick the bucket, comment And bring the next wave in. 

2a. timer for the next wave to come in just in case the player can't find or hit a ship in some weird spot.

3. End scene/level on the last wave, (maybe too much for one prompt but chatgpt can find Atlantis🤷🏾‍♂️)
